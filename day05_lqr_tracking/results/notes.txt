Day05: LQR Tracking
wn=1.0, zeta=0.2
Plain LQR:
K_plain = [[2.31662479 2.00691703]]

Augmented LQR:
Kx = [[7.1644076  3.53558321]]
Ki = [[-7.07106781]]

Observations:
- Plain LQR is a regulator; tracking step reference leaves steady-state error.
- Integral augmentation drives steady-state error to ~0 for constant reference.
- Control effort increases slightly with integral action.
